Pipelining in computer architecture:  MIPS pipelining implementation
 
Pipelining is the process of accumulating instruction from the processor through a pipeline. It allows storing and executing instructions in an orderly process.
An instruction pipeline reads instruction from the memory while previous instructions are being executed in other segments of the pipeline.
Thus, multiple instructions can be executed simultaneously.It is an implementation technique that uses parallelism (which exists among the actions needed to execute an instruction).  
So as to make our CPU work fast Pipelining is the key implementation technique that is in use these days.
In our project we are going to implement pipelining in MIPS architecture so as to observe the way that data dependencies can be handled by the system.
